A simple cross platform checklist app.

The source code is available at https://github.com/krakan/plocka/.

Why
---

In spite of trying out a number of existing apps for my weekly shopping lists, I've failed to
find one that works the way I want it to and that isn't too buggy. Also it's more fun building
your own.

Apps
----

Although the code is cross platform, I do not provide any prebuilt apps for any platform. On
the other hand you do not need any specific app to run Plocka, a Python environment with
support for Kivy would be enough - on an Android phone you could run Pydroid or Kivy Launcher.

The README.md file has some instructions for how to build you own Android app and Google can
tell you how to build one for iOS.
